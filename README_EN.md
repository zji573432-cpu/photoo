## 🎯 What is photoo?

**photoo** is an Android-native minimalist photo organization tool.

Swipe cards to quickly organize your photo gallery—swipe left to delete, right to favorite, up to keep. Plus a bunch of "nice to have" features: photo analysis with personalized photography insights, immersive photo review like scrolling through short videos, smart detection of similar photos and low-quality images, video and image compression...

**But photoo isn't just a "cleanup" tool—it's about "memories".**

## ✨ Key Features

### 👆 Swipe to Organize
Just like scrolling through short videos. Cards are shuffled by default—you never know what comes next. It could be from last week, or from a year ago. The mystery keeps you going.

* Swipe left to delete, right to favorite, up to keep
* Each card shows shooting time, location, and on-device AI recognition of what's in the photo
* 16 cards per batch (adjustable 10-30 in settings), turning thousands of photos into quick "micro-tasks"

### 🧠 Photo Analysis
Quickly generate your personal photography profile. Understand your shooting habits and record every shutter press.

### 🔍 Smart Detection
* **Similar Photos**: Auto-find duplicate or nearly identical photos
* **Low-Quality Images**: Detect blurry, dark, overexposed shots
* **Video/Image Compression**: Size down without noticeable quality loss

### 💾 Undo Function
* Supports undo operations
* Adjust before final deletion—minimize accidental deletes

### 🔒 Privacy First

**This is photoo's bottom line—and what sets us apart.**

Photos are absolutely private. That's why photoo was built around one core principle: **privacy protection**:

* **Zero Network**: No internet permissions needed
* **Zero Data Upload**: All analysis happens locally
* **100% On-Device**: Face detection, image classification—all on your phone

To achieve this, we made a bold decision: **no ads, in-app purchases, or subscriptions**—because those often require internet access and third-party SDKs.

**photoo will always be free, ad-free, no registration required, and can work completely offline.**
